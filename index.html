	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>The purpose of this website is to get Christians to use their bibles more often
	when figuring out which doctrines of our faith are accurate. A non-believer
	would be able to use this website for learning and research purposes, but
	my target audience are people who are already believers.
	</p>
	<p>I am of the opinion that too many believers, especially where I am located in
	the United States, espouse ideas that are not in line with what is actually
	said in the Bible.
	</p>
	<p>According to the Pew Research Center, 65% of adults polled in the United States
	describe themselves as Christian. That is a great deal of people, and I can assure 
	you that many are lost. 
	</p>
	<p>Ask them what happens when their loved ones die.
	Ask them why they choose to celebrate Christmas, Halloween, or Easter.
    Ask them why they believe in the Trinity doctrine. Ask why they use a cross
    in worship. These and many other questions cannot be answered by them 
    or their explanation is unbiblical.
   </p>
   <p>This state of affairs is unacceptable, in my opinion. The Bible urges
   believers to study, meditate on, and gain wisdom from its writings. Psalm 119:15-16
    wants us to meditate on God's word, to consider God's ways, and to delight
    in God's decrees. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 says that all scripture is useful for
    teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness. Deuteronomy
    11:18-23 presents to us the extremes we should be going through in order
    to learn and remember God's decrees. Jesus says in John 8:31-32, that
    in order for us to know the "truth", we have to hold to his teachings.
